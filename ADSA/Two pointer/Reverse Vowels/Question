In a user profile system of a popular app, usernames are often modified based on certain formatting rules to enhance visual appeal or ensure uniqueness. One such rule is to reverse only the vowels of a username, without altering the position of consonants or the case of any characters.

You are tasked with writing a program that processes a given string (representing a username) and reverses only the vowels in it. The rest of the characters, including their positions, should remain unchanged.

Vowels to consider: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and their uppercase variants 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.

Input Format

A single line string s (the username) containing only English letters.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

Print the modified string after reversing the vowels.
