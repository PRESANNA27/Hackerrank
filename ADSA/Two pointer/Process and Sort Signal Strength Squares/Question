You are working on a signal processing module for a weather satellite system. The system logs signal strengths as integers in a non-decreasing order. Due to certain transformations, you need to square each signal value and then reorganize the list to maintain non-decreasing order.

Write a program to take an array of sorted integers as input, square each number, and return the result as a sorted array.

Input Format

First line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴) – number of signal values.
Second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (−10⁴ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁴).
Constraints

NA

Output Format

Print the squared and sorted signal values as space-separated integers on a single line.

Sample Output 0

0 1 9 16 100
Explanation 0

Squaring: [16, 1, 0, 9, 100]
Sorted output: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]
