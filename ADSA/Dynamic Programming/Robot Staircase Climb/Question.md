A robot is programmed to climb a staircase. The robot can move either 1 step or 2 steps at a time.

Given n steps in the staircase, determine how many distinct ways the robot can reach the top.

The robot can take the steps in any combination — for example, it can take two 1-steps or one 2-step to cover 2 stairs.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n — the total number of steps.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 45

Output Format

Output a single integer — the number of distinct ways the robot can climb to the top.
