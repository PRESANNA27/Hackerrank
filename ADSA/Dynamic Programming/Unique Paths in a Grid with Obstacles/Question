You are developing a navigation system for delivery robots inside a warehouse. The warehouse is represented as a 2D grid of size m x n, where each cell can either be empty (0) or contain an obstacle (1).

The robot starts at the top-left corner (1, 1) and must reach the bottom-right corner (m, n). It can only move right or down at any point.

Your task is to write a program that calculates the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination without passing through obstacles.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers m and n (number of rows and columns).
The next m lines each contain n integers (0 or 1), representing the grid.
Constraints

1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100
grid[i][j] ∈ {0, 1}
Output Format

A single integer representing the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, avoiding obstacles.
