A robot is placed in the top-left corner of an m x n grid.

It can move only right or down from its current cell.

Your task is to compute the total number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers m and n — the number of rows and columns of the grid.

Constraints

1 <= m, n <= 100

Output Format

Output a single integer — the total number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right.

The robot can take the following paths:

(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1)

(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1)

Explanation 1

The robot can take the following paths:

(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (1, 2)

(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2)

(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2)
