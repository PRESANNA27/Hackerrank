A network administrator, Sam, is analyzing logs from a cybersecurity monitoring system. Each log entry contains a timestamp representing when a particular security event was recorded. The logs are stored in non-decreasing order of timestamps, meaning they are sorted but may contain duplicate timestamps if an event occurred multiple times.

Given the sorted list of timestamps and a specific event timestamp X, Sam needs your help to find the first and last occurrence of X in the log. If the event did not occur, return [-1, -1].

You must implement an efficient algorithm with O(log n) complexity.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of log entries.
The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the sorted timestamps.
The third line contains an integer X, representing the timestamp of the event to be searched.
Constraints

0 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
-10^9 ≤ Timestamp ≤ 10^9
The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Output Format

Print the first and last occurrence indices of X as [first, last].
If the event timestamp is not found, return [-1, -1].
Sample Input 0

6 
5 7 7 8 8 10 
8 
Sample Output 0

[3, 4]
Explanation 0

The log entries {5,7,7,8,8,10} contain event 8 at indices 3 and 4.

Sample Input 1

6
5 7 7 8 8 10 
6 
Sample Output 1

[-1, -1]
Explanation 1

The event 6 is not present in {5,7,7,8,8,10}, so the output is [-1, -1].

Sample Input 2

0 
0 
Sample Output 2

[-1, -1]
Explanation 2

The log is empty, so the event 0 is not found.
