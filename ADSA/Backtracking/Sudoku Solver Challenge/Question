Imagine you are developing a feature for a puzzle app where users can input a partially filled Sudoku board, and the system should automatically solve it for them. Sudoku is a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids, where each row, column, and subgrid must contain all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

Your task is to write a program that takes such a Sudoku puzzle as input and fills in the empty cells (denoted by '.') to produce a valid, solved Sudoku grid.

Input Format

You will read 9 lines from the user.
Each line contains exactly 9 characters: digits '1'–'9' for filled cells, and '.' for empty cells.
Constraints

NA

Output Format

If a solution exists, print the solved 9x9 grid, each row as a line with digits separated by spaces.
If no solution exists, print:
No solution exists for the given Sudoku puzzle.
Sample Input 0

Sample Output 0

Enter the Sudoku grid (9 lines, each 9 characters, use '.' for empty cells):
