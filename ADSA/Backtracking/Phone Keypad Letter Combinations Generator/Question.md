Imagine you are building a smartphone keyboard app that needs to suggest all possible letter combinations when a user types a sequence of digits (2–9) on their numeric keypad, similar to the classic telephone button mappings.

Each digit maps to a set of letters as follows:

2 → a, b, c
3 → d, e, f
4 → g, h, i
5 → j, k, l
6 → m, n, o
7 → p, q, r, s
8 → t, u, v
9 → w, x, y, z
Your task is to generate all possible combinations of letters that the given sequence of digits can represent. This is useful for predictive text, contact name searching, or password generation tools.

Input Format

A single string digits (length ≤ 4), containing only characters from '2' to '9'.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

A list of strings, where each string is a possible letter combination, in any order.

Sample Input 0

23
Sample Output 0

[ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf]
Explanation 0

The digit '2' maps to 'a', 'b', 'c' and '3' maps to 'd', 'e', 'f'.
All possible combinations are generated by pairing each letter from '2' with each letter from '3'.
Sample Input 1

2
Sample Output 1

[a, b, c]
Explanation 1

Since only one digit is given, the combinations are simply the individual letters mapped to '2'.
