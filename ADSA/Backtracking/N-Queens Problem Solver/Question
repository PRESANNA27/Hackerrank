You are tasked with building a chess game assistant that can solve the classic N-Queens problem: placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means:

No two queens can share the same row.
No two queens can share the same column.
No two queens can share the same diagonal.
Input Format

A single integer n — the size of the chessboard and the number of queens.

Constraints

NA

Output Format

Print each solution as a block of n strings, each of length n.
Separate different solutions by a blank line.
The order of solutions does not matter.
